# Introduction #

Cytoseg should serve to reduce the overhead in experimenting with algorithms for neuropil segmentation. It should provide the user ability to try various multiscale segmentation approaches quickly and observes the results in 3D. Modular components should be built to handle various stages of multiscale processing.
